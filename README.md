Goal of this project is to implement in Python programming language some of the experiments presented in the article.  

Article is treating a problem of Biomedical named entity recognition (BNER), as a specific natural language processing problem of automated extracting of important named entities such as genes and proteins from biomedical texts. In the past there were three common approaches in solving these type of problems, rule-based, dictionary-based and machine learning approaches (treating it as sequence labeling problem). Author explored use of DNN for resolving this challenge.
